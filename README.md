dailymotion-dl
==============
dailymotion-dl

this is a simple link extractor for dailymotion.com.

just type 
>python dailymotion-dl.py (web link) 

and it will start to extract the absolute video url.

example :
=========
>>python dailymotion-dl.py www.dailymotion.com/video/xy8ddj_zindagi-gulzar-hai-by-hum-tv-episode-16-part-1-3_shortfilms

By the way if you forget to give it a website url it will itself prompt you to write it.

If you want something else then tell me. I am actually learning python and experimenting with it.

My main motivation for this was youtube-dl.

Where it is used:
===================
I used this script on one on my hobby projects http://www.dailymotion-dl.appspot.com
but currently the download link it produces is not working however you can use this script locally and it should work.....:)
